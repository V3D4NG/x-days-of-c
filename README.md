repo_description: this repository is dedicated to mastering the c language through solving problems and making projects. 

reason for learning c:- 
since the c language was created in 1972, it has come to dominate much of the programming world. every major operating system is written in c.
thus, whenever any other language wants to communicate with an operating system, it must utilise a foreign function interface.
for this reason, c is not just a programming language anymore, it has become a protocol. (read more at (obligatory profanity warning): https://faultlore.com/blah/c-isnt-a-language/ )
hence, anyone working as a developer must have some understanding of the c language.
